# CSS Grid Challenge: SUBMISSIONS DUE SEPT 30th 2017!
By Vitaly Friedman

Layout on the web has always been tricky, but with CSS Grid being now
supported in all major browsers, most of the hacks that helped to achieve
complex layouts have become obsolete. Firefox even has a CSS Grid
Inspector built in, so that there’s nothing to hold you back from making
even the most challenging flexible layout reality.

To explore the possibilities and features of Grid together, we’d love to invite you to a little
contest. Because there’s nothing better to completely grasp a new technology as getting
your hands dirty and playing with it, right?

## THE CHALLENGE
Now, here’s the challenge: You create an original, accessible layout with CSS Grid, or use
CSS Grid to rebuild an existing layout. What you design is entirely up to you. The only
requirement is that the template works fine in IE9 but is still accessible in IE8.
At the end of the contest, all templates and layouts will be open sourced and made
available to everyone for free download and use (both personal and commercial). The aim
is to build a community repository full of CSS Grid goodness that inspires fellow
developers and helps spread the Grid revolution.
All the submitted pages or templates will be available for free and under the MIT license, so
that you can use the templates for commercial projects, as well.

## SO, WHAT CAN YOU WIN?
After the deadline has ended, we’ll announce the lucky winners who’ll win a quite
extraordinary smashing prize (and a couple of other Smashing extras, see below):
- **a round-trip flight to Barcelona, Spain,**
- **full accommodation in a fancy hotel,**
- **a ticket to the Smashing Conference Barcelona 20172,**
- **a Smashing workshop of your choice,**
- **a signed edition of our upcoming book Design Systems3 by Alla Kholmatova,**
- **your very own Smashing caricature, designed just for you.**

## Join In!
Want to be a part of it? Great, we’d love to see what you’ll come up with! So once you’ve
completed your shiny CSS Grid layout, please send us a link to
cssgrid@smashingmagazine.com it (CodePen works just fine) until *September 30*. You can
also post your work right here in our GitHub Site.
